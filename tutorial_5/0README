This folder contains example inputs designed to calculate small molecule
hydration free energies with Amber14 and TINKER 7.0.

Tinker 7.0 requires the use of the tinker_to_amber conversion program
available with Ambertools 14. Earlier versions of tinker_to_amber will
not work with xyz files containing box dimensions.

WE also include scripts designed to aid the setup and analysis of these
calculations (e.g. automated production of parameter files at defined
lambda windows, scripts to perform BAR analysis of Amber & Tinker outputs prior
to version 6.3), but these are adapted from those publicly available on the
Pengyu Ren group website:

1) PROTOCOL

The overall protocol is similar to that defined in Y.Shi et al., "Multipole
Electrostatics in Hydration Free Energy Calculations", J. Comput. Chem.,2010,
32,5,967-977. The thermodynamic cycle in use requires three sets of calculations:

i) Discharging of solute in solution ("ele")
ii) Decoupling of vdW interactions between solute & environment in solution ("vdw")
iii) Discharging of solute in vacuum ("intra")

Free energy changes across each window are evaluated by BAR and summed to give
a total dG for each step. The overall dG(hyd) is then given by:

dG(hyd) = dG(intra) - dG(ele) - dG(vdw)

2) EXAMPLE

The input files here perform a HFE for the small molecule Geraniol. AMOEBA
parameters were produced using the Poltype 1.1.2 program in its standard form.

We use Amber for the simulations in solution, and TINKER for those in vacuum,
just for speed. If you wish to do the same, please check both packages give
the same energies given the same inputs.

3) FILES

Contents and instructions are available in separate readme files.
