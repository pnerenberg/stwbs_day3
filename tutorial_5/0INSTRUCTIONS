Instructions to run HFE of Geraniol

Notes ***particularly on the use of pmemd.amoeba*** and accreditations for 
some of these scripts are available in the Readme

################################################################################

1) Ensure $AMBERHOME/bin, $TINKERHOME/bin, BAR-amber and BAR-tinker are in your 
PATH.

2) Run hfe_setup.pl < hfe_setup.in
Adaptations to lambda window spacing etc. can be made in hfe_setup.in - if you
want to see the meanings of each line simply run hfe_setup.pl without any
arguments for interactive input.

Briefly, the script will take a TINKER xyz of the ligand, soak it in a box of
AMOEBA water, run tinker_to_amber to convert TINKER parameters and coordinates
to Amber prmtop and inpcrd, repeat the same for each lambda window, and finally
create inputs for analysis of results with BAR-amber and BAR-tinker.

3) Minimise and equilibrate the resulting Amber inpcrd as normal. This file and
the required input files are automatically moved to a directory called "start".
Copy the final equilibrated structure into each of the lambda window folders 
with restart_copy.sh.

4) Perform the simulations. This can be automated using the setup_elesims.sh
and setup_vdwsims.sh. Adapt these to your own cluster's environment. We also
do not include a script to automate the running of the TINKER gas phase 
simulations. Currently the BAR analysis assumes that the gas phase simulations
have the same length and frequency of trajectory output as the condensed phase
simulations. Try to construct a script that automates the running of these
simulations!

5) Perform the energy extraction and analysis. Each lambda window has the 
required files, but we include scripts that automate this procedure.

6) BAR free energies for each step are summarised in ele_pasted.txt, vdw_pasted.txt
and intra_pasted.txt. Each column represents a lambda window from 1.0 to 0.0,
each row corresponds to the cumulative dG at 100 ps intervals. The first 100 ps
are discarded as equilibration, hence the first line = dG after 200 ps.

The overall dG(hyd) = dG(intra) - dG(ele) - dG(vdw).
